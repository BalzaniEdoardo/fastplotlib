# Examples

**IMPORTANT NOTE: If you install `fastplotlib` and `pygfx` from `pypi`, i.e. `pip install pygfx`, you will need to use the examples from the following commit until `pygfx` publishes a new release to `pypi`: https://github.com/kushalkolar/fastplotlib/tree/f872155eb687b18e3cc9b3b720eb9e241a9f974c/examples . 
The current examples will work if you installed `fastplotlib` and `pygfx` directly from github**

Both `fastplotlib` and `pygfx` are rapidly evolving libraries, and we try to closely track `pygfx`.
