# fastplotlib governance

The governance of fastplotlib applies to all fastplotlib related activities. This includes the fastplotlib github organization, all repositories under the fastplotlib github organization, as well as any events or workshops organized by members of the fastplotlib Leadership Team.

## Mission

Leverage new graphics APIs and modern GPU hardware to create fast and interactive scientific visualizations using an expressive and elegant API.

## Leadership team

### Maintainers

The maintainers are the core developers of fastplotlib and together have a complete understanding of the codebase.

1. [Kushal Kolar](https://github.com/kushalkolar)
1. [Caitlin Lewis](https://github.com/clewis7)


### Advisory Committee 

The advisory committee hold a significant stake in fastplotlib as determined by the **Maintainers**. The responsibilities of the **Advisory Committee** are to 1) attend a yearly roadmap meeting, 2) be available for conflict resolution.

1. Eric Thomson
1. Guillaume Viejo
1. Andrea Giovannucci
1. John Pearson

### Neutral moderator

No voting power, has no stake in the fastplotlib project 

* Reagan Bullins

### Voting power distribution

Maintainers: 50%

Advisory Committee: 50%

Veto: Any vote can be vetoed by a unanimous vote within the maintainers.

Note that currently the voting power is primarily held by the maintainers - Kushal Kolar & Caitlin Lewis. This is intentional since the library is in an early stage. Knowledge of the codebase and its inner workings are predominantly held by Kushal & Caitlin, and nobody else.

### Voting Process

1. For the purpose of conflict resolution the leadership team must be convened by the neutral moderator. In all other situations the leadership team may be convened by one of the maintainers.
1. Once the leadership committee is convened and discussions have occurred, voting must conclude within 1 hour.
1. Voting is performed anonymously and handled solely by the neutral moderator in the case of conflict resolution, or by one of the maintainers.
1. After voting has finished, any maintainer may invoke a veto vote. If the veto succeeds, then the same item may not be voted on for 100 days.

## Adding members to the Leadership Team

### Confirming Maintainers

* Given to individuals on merit basis after they have demonstrated strong expertise of the library through contributions, reviews and discussions.
* Adding a maintainer requires one of:
  * a unanimous vote by current maintainers
  * 75% vote within the advisory committee
* For continued membership in the maintainer group the individual has to demonstrate strong and continued alignment with the fastplotlib mission. The individual must also actively commit to the repo, respond to issues, and review pull requests.
* The membership is for an individual, not a company or organization.
* There must always be a minimum of 2 maintainers.
* A maintainer may be removed by one of:
  * 60% vote within the maintainers
  * 75% vote within the advisory committee

### Confirming an advisory committee member

* A candidate advisory committee member may only be nominated by a current maintainer or advisory committee member.
* Candidate must have used fastplotlib in their own work or library, or made contributions to fastplotlib.
* Candidate must be committed to the mission and demonstrate, with examples, how their role on the advisory committee would further the mission.
* If the Individual fulfills the above criteria they may be considered. The Leadership Team then requires an overall 80% vote to add the candidate as an advisory member.
* The membership is for an individual, not a company or organization.
  * 60% vote within the maintainers
  * 75% vote within the advisory committee

## Invoking a vote from the leadership team 

### Conflict

Anyone (absolutely anyone, not just the leadership team members) who feels that the code of conduct or governance document has been breached may invoke a vote by contacting the neutral moderator.

#### Process

1. Contact the neutral moderator with a description of the conflict, max of 250 words.
2. Neutral moderator must schedule a vote within 15 days. If that is not possible then within the next 45 days.
3. If there is a special case that requires urgency, such as upcoming events, workshops, etc., the neutral moderator may try to schedule a vote ASAP. Exercising this urgency is solely at the discretion of the neutral moderator.
4. The individual who has invoked the conflict vote can choose to present their case, or they may choose to let the neutral moderator represent them.
    * Every individual involved in the conflict is given a maximum of 15 minutes to be represented. This time limit may be expanded at the discretion of the neutral moderator if a justifiable reason is provided.
5. The Leadership Team votes on one of the actions from “Enforcement Guidelines”: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/. It is advised that the first offense leads to action (1) “Correction” and then go down the list for repeated conflicts from the same individual/organization. Very bad behavior, as determined by the leadership team, can justify a first offense resulting in (3) “Temporary Ban” or (4) “Permanent Ban”.
6. Voting is performed as described in the section **Voting Process**.

### Adding a member to the leadership team
1. A current maintainer or advisory committee member may nominate a candidate and then contact the neutral moderator with a written summary, of no more than 100 words, with reasons for adding the candidate to the Leadership Team.
1. The nominator should specify whether the candidate should be a maintainer or advisory committee member.
1. The neutral moderator must then schedule a vote within 100 days.
1. The nominator and candidate may then speak for no more than 10 minutes each on why the candidate should be added to the leadership team.
1. Voting is performed as described in the section **Voting Process**.
